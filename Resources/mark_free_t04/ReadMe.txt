Sample Model
Mark-kun - FREE

============================================================

　This model can be used to learn about ArtPath and Frame Step.

  Frame Step is used to reproduce sharp movement such as limited animation.
  The effect lines when the character jumps and the scattering grass effect when he lands are created using 
  ArtPath to produce lines within the editor without reimporting the PSD.
